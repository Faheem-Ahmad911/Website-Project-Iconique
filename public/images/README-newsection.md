# New Section Images

This directory should contain the following images for the new section:

## Required Images:

1. **newsectionimage-desktop.jpg**
   - Dimensions: 1200x400px (recommended)
   - Format: JPEG
   - Purpose: Desktop/tablet display
   - Content: Featured promotional image or banner

2. **newsectionimage-mobile.jpg**  
   - Dimensions: 768x300px (recommended)
   - Format: JPEG
   - Purpose: Mobile display
   - Content: Mobile-optimized version of the featured content

## Image Guidelines:

- **Desktop Image**: Should be wider aspect ratio (3:1) to work well on desktop screens
- **Mobile Image**: Should be more square aspect ratio (2.5:1) for better mobile viewing
- **Quality**: High resolution, optimized for web
- **Content**: Should align with your brand's aesthetic and current promotional content
- **File Size**: Keep under 500KB for optimal loading performance

## Implementation:

The images are automatically responsive:
- Desktop image shows on screens > 768px wide
- Mobile image shows on screens ≤ 768px wide
- Hover effect includes a subtle zoom animation
- Images maintain aspect ratio while filling the container

To add your images, simply place them in the `/public/images/` directory with the exact filenames listed above.
